## Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to our work. Your help is essential for keeping it great!

Contributions to a project are released to the public under the project's open source license.

Please note that all our projects are released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in our projects, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Reporting a bug, providing a suggestion & contributing additional content

If you find that our code is not working as advertised in the project's README or have ideas on improving it, please create a GitHub Issue on the project's repository. Be sure to include:

- A name, identifier or code snippet you're having trouble with  (for ex: for SecureX Orchestration content, what atomic action or workflow are you experiencing issues with)
- A description of the issue you encountered
- Steps we can take to reproduce the issue
- (Optional) A pull request with your content (more on how to do this below)

### Submitting a pull request

1. Fork and clone the project's repository
2. Add your content in (be sure to document!)
3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
4. Pat yourself on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow standards for style and code quality
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
